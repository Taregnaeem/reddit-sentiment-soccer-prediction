# Reddit Soccer comments-based soccer match result prediction

In this project, my goal is to predict the soccer match results based on the sentiment of the comments in the corresponding Reddit soccer (r/soccer) post-match threads. 
First, I collect the raw data using reddit API. For each match, I design and compute various sentiment metrics classified by the commenter's flair (team). 
Second, using statistical tests, I draw inferences on the variance in the sentiment for different flair types across different results. Using this analysis, 
I evaluate machine learning models for match result prediction based on the sentiment.
